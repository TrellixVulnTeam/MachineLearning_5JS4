# Multivariable Linear Regression
This repository contains a basic implementation of the Linear Regression model with multiple variables.

Included in this repository
* Regular Python (only used NumPy for the matrices representations and operations)
* TensorFlow Low-Level API

## Installation
To install TensorFlow, first make sure you're using Python 3.X 64 bit and run:
```
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
pip3 install --upgrade numpy
```

## How to use this repository
1. Install the libraries (make sure they are correctly installed).
2. Use the ```loader.py```'s loadData function to load data from a URL. (Make sure to add one's columnd to the data matrix)
3. Use one of the examples, with or without TensorFlow, the code is commented and hopefully you'll be able to understand what is going on
4. Have fun!
